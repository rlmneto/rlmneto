# 👋 Raul M. Neto | Purple Team Practitioner & Software Engineer 🛡️🐍

🛡️ *Transforming Code into Resilience through Offensive Engineering & Defensive Automation*

I'm a **Senior Software Developer** specialized in Python system integrations, currently transitioning my career into **Purple Team** operations. My unique strength lies at the intersection of building complex, robust architectures and knowing exactly how to break, monitor, and defend them.

## 🧪 Featured Project: Home SOC Lab (Wazuh)
Actively building a comprehensive home-based detection and response environment.

- **Objective**: Deploy a full-stack SIEM/XDR using Wazuh to monitor hybrid endpoints  
- **Key Features**: Log ingestion (Sysmon / Auditd), custom detection rules targeting Python-based exploits, automated response scripts  
- **Tech Stack**: Wazuh, Ubuntu Server, Docker, Python (automation & scripting), MITRE ATT&CK mapping  
- **Goal**: Bridge the gap between development logic and real-time threat detection & response
