# 👋 Raul M. Neto | Purple Team Practitioner & Software Engineer 🛡️🐍

🛡️ *Transforming Code into Resilience through Offensive Engineering & Defensive Automation*

I'm a **Senior Software Developer** specialized in Python system integrations, currently transitioning my career into **Purple Team** operations. My unique strength lies at the intersection of building complex, robust architectures and knowing exactly how to break, monitor, and defend them.

## 🧪 Featured Project: Home IDS Lab (Suricata on Raspberry Pi)
Actively building a lightweight, low-cost intrusion detection environment focused on real network visibility.

- **Objective**: Deploy a dedicated IDS using Suricata on a Raspberry Pi 2B to monitor network traffic and detect malicious activity
- **Key Features**: Network traffic inspection, custom Suricata rules, alert generation, protocol analysis, attacker behavior detection
- **Tech Stack**: Suricata, Raspberry Pi 2B, Linux, TCP/IP analysis, IDS rule tuning
- **Goal**: Develop hands-on detection engineering skills by understanding attacks at the packet and protocol level
